Specs:
   a pomodoro time counter with the image of a small clock at the upper right hand corner:
    - the counter is made up of a 25-minute work interval (a pomodoro)
    - a 3 - 5-minute break is given between intervals
    - between sets of 4 work intervals(4 pomodoros = a set), there is a 30-minute break reminder
    a list of 20 favorite songs
    - the songs are to be randomly chosen by the program
    - songs, ideally, are only 3 - 5 minutes long
   a chosen browser
   links to the music videos of the songs

   1. 2 counters are defined:
      counter 1 is for a single pomodoro

   2. A pomodoro timer appears
   3. Once counter 1 reaches 25 minutes, a song is randomly selected from the list.
   4. The image of the clock disappears.
   5. The chosen browser is opened with the url of the music video to be played.
   6. Once a single song finishes, the browser is closed.
